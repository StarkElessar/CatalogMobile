# CatalogMobile Ruby on Rails App

## Developing a small App using PostgreSQL

This is an open source web application that makes me happy, my code is transformed, and my knowledge increases.
For this web application I used technologies such as:

- HTML
- SASS
- Webpack
- PostgreSQL
- Ruby on Rails 7

---

To run the application - clone it from the git repository,
install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server:

```sh
bin/dev
```
